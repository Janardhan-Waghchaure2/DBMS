1. it is exactly same as specialization , only difference is that we think from "Bottom-Up" Approch.

2. ex:- we have 3 entities like SUV , BUS , Truck.

      and after thinking  a while below were the attributes of each entities.


      SUV :- fuel CAPACITY , milage , horse power ,  number_of_seats , etc..
      BUS :- fuel CAPACITY , milage , horse power ,  number_of_seats , load_carring_capacity , etc..
      Truck :- fuel CAPACITY , number_of_wheels , milage , horse power ,  number_of_seats , etc..

      and after seeing above we realized that all 3 entities have 3 attributes in common 

      so why not to create an superclass entity like "vehicle" which will have above common attributes
      and SUV  , BUS , Truck will simily have "is-a" relationship with that entity.

3. as we initially had 3 entities and we build top level entity later on hence we call this bottom up Approch.

4. both specialization and generalization looks same on ER-diagramme.
   only thinking process of creating them is differnt.

   in specialization we create child entities from parent entity
   in generalization we create parent entities from child entity

5. IN BOTH specialization AND generalization CHILD ENTITY WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE PARENT CLASS ATTRIBUTES.
