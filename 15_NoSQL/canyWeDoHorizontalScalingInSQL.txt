1. yes , we cant do Horizontal scaling in SQL. BUT ITS PRACTICALLY NOT POSSIBLE.

2. lets say users have increased and load on server was increased so we brought new servers/nodes in our system.
   and we distributed some of the tables of our relational model on those servers.

   ex:- we had total 6 tables in DB lets say and total 3 servers(s1, s2, s3)/nodes(placed geographically distant) , so each node 
        will be having 2 tables init.

3. now lets say we want to apply the join IN SQL(at s2 server)  and we are fetching the info. from 
   distant servers(s2 and s3) to our server(s2). NOW DOING THIS IS PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE BUT IT CONSUMES SO 
   MUCH OF TIME TO DO. 

    ex:- imagine we open instagrame and waiting for minutes for just home page to load , 
         imagine we have open gmail and we are just waiting for emils to get loaded its not a 
         good user expirience


4. hence Horizontal scalling is best achived with NoSQL databases where there is no any 
  tables kind of structure.



5. servers = nodes = computing machines.
