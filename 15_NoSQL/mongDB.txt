1. MongoDB is a NoSQL database.

2. it stores the data in form of BSON.(similar to JSON objects)

3. to store a unit of the data in in SQL database we have tuple or row of database.
   but in MongoDB we have a JAVA SCRIPT OBJECT like thing which stores data in 
   key : value format.


ex:- to store student data , we can have 1 entry of student like 


   std = {
        f_name : "jana" ,
        l_name : "waghchaure" ,
        age : 21 , 
        hobbies : ["a" , "b" , "c"]
   }

   and MongoDB basically stores multiple of above kind of javascript objects.
