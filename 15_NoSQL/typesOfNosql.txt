1. types of Nosql Types 
    1. KeyValue


1. KeyValue model/structure :- 1. data is stored in key:value format 

                

2. column-wise/column-oriented/wide-column/c-store :-
                               1. in relational data base we store data in rows. i.e each tuple lies in a tuple.

                ex:- if we have student info then in relational database it looks like 


                std_id     name       age 
                4545       abcd       53  
                7425       xyz        33  

                in column-wise model/structure above data will look like 

                std_id          name           age 
                4545,7425       abcd,xyz       53 , 33
                                
                in column-wise data is stored horizontally in in columnwise.



3. Document based structure/model :- 
                            1. this DB stores data in document format similar to JSON , objects.
                            2. each documets contains multiple key:value pairs.
                            3. supports ACID properties and used for transactions.

            ex:- lets say we have a college database then it will look like below in Document model.

            Student {

                user_id : --- , 
                age : ---- , 
                gender : ---- ,
                f_name : ----- ,
                l_name : ---  ,
                Subject : { sub_id1 , sub_id2}
                teachers : { teacher_id1 , teacher_id2}

            }

            teacher {

                  teacher_id : ---- ,
                  subject_taught : { --- , --- , ---}
                  name : --- , 
                  age :---
            }


            Subject {
                sub_name : ------- ,
                sub_id : 

            }


            from above we can see the schema for Document model can also have realtions like 
            realational model SO YES WE CAN ALSO IMPLEMENT RELATIONS LIKE SQL IN Nosql ALSO.



4. Graph based model.
        1. data is stored in graph based data structure.
           ex:- facebook and  socail media uses it ,
                google maps uses it.
