1. NoSQL(aka "not only sql") , it means that data in NoSQL is not stored in form of tables instead they are stored in some other format.

                                            OR  

    data is not stored in relational tables form.

2. NoSQL can store data in any of the below type 
        1. document 
        2. key:value 
        3. wide-column 
        4. graph.

3. NoSQL databases provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amount of data and high user laods.



SQL	                                            NoSQL

Tables with fixed rows and fixed columns        Json docments , key-value pairs , wide-column , graphes


Developed in 1970s with goal to reduce           Developed in 2000s with focus of scaling , rapid-Developement ,
data redundancy as cost of storage was high      high - speed reading/fetching of data.
and hence all the concepts like normalization 
,etc. was used to reduce redundancy and reduce
storage space.


RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)	Non-relational or distributed database system.

These databases have fixed or static or         They have dynamic schema 
predefined schema	

These databases are not suited for          	These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.

Vertically Scalable	                            Horizontally scalable

Follows ACID property	                        Follows CAP(consistency, availability, partition tolerance)
                                                generally dont follow ACID.                                

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL,                 	Examples: MongoDB, GraphQL, HBase, Neo4j, Cassandra, etc

scaling :- increasing the memory capacity or computing capacity of servers because 
                1. storage space of servers are running out so more space/storage is needed 
                2. computing is getting slower due to more users hitting servers.
           is called scaling.

                                        types of scaling 
                        1. Vertical                       2.Horizontal
                  increasing ram , increasing             here we simply add more 
                  SSD or HDD , adding more                number of servers which 
                  powerful cpu ,etc ON SAME               shaires the total load.
                  SERVER/MACHINE. 
                  
                  this is more costly                     this is less costly.

          Horizontal scaling = scaling out 
          Vertical scaling   = scaling up 
        
        note that its not compulsorly to scale Horizontally in nosql , because scaling up Vertically is costly 
        hence its preffered to scale Horizontally.


Advantages of NoSQL
1. flexible schema : in sql we have to provide values of all the attributes compulsorly , but in 
                     NoSQL we dont have to WE CAN SIMPLY SKIP SOME ATTRIBUTES IF WE WANT OR WE CAN ADD 
                     SOME EXTRA ATTRIBUTES IF NEEDED.

                     schema of MongoDB.
                     here some attrobutes of std1 is removed in std2 and some extra is added in std2.

                        std1 = {
                                f_name : "jana" ,
                                l_name : "waghchaure" ,
                                age : 21 , 
                                hobbies : ["a" , "b" , "c"]
                        }

                        std2 = {
                                f_name : "jana" ,
                                m_name : "rajendra"
                                l_name : "waghchaure" ,
                                prn    : 345353645
                        }

2. Horizontal scaling :-  SQL databases dont allow to have multiple small servers handling the load.
                          because it is difficult to spread all the tables of relational DB accross multiple servers.
                          but NoSQL databases allows to do Horizontal scalling which is a cost effective.

                        ex:- lets say a databse of student in made in SQL and NoSQL DB.
                        now in SQL database we have student ,subjects , professor , exam , etc.. tables formed
                        so to fetch a complte data of student we have to apply joing and other things on SQL DB.

                        whereas in NoSQL server simply made key:tuple where entire data(marks ,professor , exams , student info.) 
                        related to student is stored to one place. now as there is no copuling of ONE STUDENT TO OTHER STUDNET 
                        (LIKE ONE TABLE IS CONNECTED TO OTHER IN REALTIONAL MODEL) HENCE we can easily distribute this students on 
                        multiple servers.

                        thats why we are saying that Horizontal scaling is easily achived in NoSQL DB's.


                        ALSO NOTE THAT EACH OF THE STUDENT JSON OBJECT OF NoSQL DB IS CONTAINING THE REPEATED DATA LIKE 
                        SUBJECTS , PROFESSORS , EXAMS ,ETC.. which we used to create tables in sql to reduce the redundancy in DB.

                        WHICH MEANS THAT IN NoSQL DB. WE DONT CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT DATA redundancy , WE SIMPLY 
                        DESIGN "EVERYTHING FOR SPEED".


3. high availability :- as same data is stored on multiple servers in HENCE IF ONE SERVER FAILS THEN REQUESTS 
                        ARE DIRECTED TO NEXT SERVER.

                        AND DUE TO THIS NoSQL DB's provide good availability.



4. high speed         :- operations like read , insert , etc.. occurs at high speed in NoSQL databases as all the data is 
                         not distributed over different tables. all the data is on one place hence time complexity of fetching 
                         or manipulating data is better for NoSQL as compaired to SQL databasess.


                         ex:- all the data of one student is stored in a simple json like key:value format in NoSQL 
                              where sql have 4-5 different tables where student data is distributed which makes feching and 
                              manipuation of data slower.



5. caching meachanism exists in NoSQL.

6. nosql  used mostly in clound operations.



Disadvantages :
        1. due to  Data redundancy present in nosql databases hence they requires more amount of storage spaces 
           as compaired to sql databases.

           BUT AS SOTRAGE COSTS ARE REDUCING AND NEED FOR SPEED IS INCRESING HENCE THIS DATA redundancy PROBLEM 
           IT NOT THAT MUCH OF BIG.

        
        2. update and delete is costly.

        3. not All NoSQL follows ACID porperties.

        4. dont support data entry consistency constrains.
