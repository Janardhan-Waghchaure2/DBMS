1. Structured data :- 1. data is arrenged in a proper tabular form.
                       ex:- .xl or sql database.
                             in each cell fixed size of integer is stored , like if we have said that each age variable 
                             will store 32 bit integer then each and every students age WILL BE FIXED SIZE OF 32 BIT.


                      2. this data is not growing that much fast as compaired to unstructured data.

                      3. easier to store in Databases and data warehouses also requires less storage space.

                      4. can be easily analyzed unsing simple tools like Excel and SQL.

2. unstructured data :-
                    1. data which can't be represented in a tabular format.
                      ex:- reviews of a customer , comment on social media , image , vidio , audio ,teweets , 
                           reels , etc...
                           
                           size of image can vary , file type of image can vary  , height-width of image can vary ,
                           etc.. so for unstructured data there is nothing which is predefined anything can change.
                           HENCE IT IS CALLED unstructured AS THERE IS NO predefined CONTRAINS.

                    2. most of the data which we see around is unstructured in nature AND IT IS GROWING EXPNENTIALLY 
                       DUE TO INTERNET.
                    
                    3. due to non-liner/unstructured way it is difficult to store and requires high storage spaces.
                       ex:- nosql  databases like MongoDB.

                    4. requires ML and AI algo. to analyze data.
                       ex:- sentiment/meaning analysis of customer review.
