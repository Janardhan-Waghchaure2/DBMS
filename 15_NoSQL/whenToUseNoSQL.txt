1. Fast-Paced Developement :- when we have requirments that Developement needs to be done in very short duration of time 
                              then nosql should be used. and the reason is that with sql we need to first design ER digramme , 
                              then make relational mode ,think of different contrains , think of what should be different table ,etc...
                              which is very lengthy process AS WE NEED TO STRUCTURE EVERYTHING IN RIGHT MANNER. hence for fast-paced 
                              Developement NoSQL is better.


2. semi-Structured or  un-Structured data :- whenever data is in Structured form then its best to use sql
                                (ex:- college DB , banking DB , etc..) but if data is in a lot of unstructure way then its 
                              better to use nosql. 

  
3. high volumne               :- for higher volumne of data nosql is used.


4. Horizontal scaling         :- whenever the requirments are to scale Horizontally then nosql is used.


5. applications like microservices and real-time streaming.
