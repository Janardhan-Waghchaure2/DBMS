1. a unit of work done against DB in logical sequence is called transaction.
   ex:- 1 transaction in a bank between account A(100 Rs balance ) and B(50 Rs balance) for 10 Rs is 

            traction_i(ith transaction in DB) 
                1. read_balance(A)
                2. decrement balance of A in temp variable
                    i.e temp = A - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90 Rs 
                3. assign decremented value in A's account.
                    i.e A = temp = 90 Rs                              
                
                4. read_balance(B)
                5. increment balance of B in temp variable
                    i.e temp = B + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 Rs 
                6. assign incremented value in B's account.
                    i.e B = temp = 60 Rs .


        so these 6 steps for machine level / computer level is just one step from user perspective or 
        we can say IT IS ACTUALLY ONLY ONE STEP(i.e send money from one account to other account)
         HENCE IT IS CALLED ONE UNIT OF WORK DONE OF DB.

2. these transactions are either should be done completly(i.e 10 Rs are sent from A to B account) or 
   beause of some error in system transaction will roll back(i.e 10 Rs which were deducted from A will 
   be sent by to A is some errors occurs)
