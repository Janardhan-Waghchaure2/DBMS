1. Strong entities are those entities which are having primary key associated with each row/datapoint 
   i.e we can uniqly identify a given row in a table.
   ex:- inside university database.
        sudents are strongs entity as they have unique key associated with each of them.



2. Weak entities are those entities which are not having primary key and hence we cannot uniqly identify
   each row.

   weak entities are dependant on strong entities.

   weak entities have to associate to strong entities for their unique identification.

   ex:- inside the bank database.
        loan is a strong entity but payment is weak entity. as payment of loan EMI's can  exist without loan.


3. relation between strong entities is strong relation and 
   related between a strong and a weak entity is weak relation.
