1. conversion of ER to Relational model.
    1. entity name becomes table name.

    2. attributes of ER becomes column names of Relational model.

    3. note that primary key attributes of ER models are kept as first column in  
       Relational model.

    
2. now tables can be made from given ER model , but how to implement the relashionship betweeen 
  the entities.

  THAT WE DO WITH HELP OF THE FOREGION KEYS. 
  I.E WE PLACE PRIMARY KEY OF OTHER TABLE IN OUR GIVEN TABLE (BUT ADDING ENTIRE NEW COLUMN OF FOREGION KEY)
  SO THAT EACH ROW/TUPLE OF FIRST TABLE WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH EACH entity OF OTHER TABLE.
