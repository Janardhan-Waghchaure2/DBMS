1. relational model is used to describe the Database in terms of tables and their relationships.
                    OR 
    relational model organizes the given data in form of tables. 

   it is similar to ER model except in ER model we draw entities and their relationships visually and in relational model 
   we make tables(analogous of entities in ER model) and their relationships among.

   

2. in relational model there are multiple tables(each of them having unique names assigned to them) which are related to each other OR tables have relationships amongs themselves.
    ex:- an college database will have tables like.
        1. Students 
        2. subjects 
        3. professors 
        4. Exams , etc... which are are related to each other.


    IN RELASHIONAL MODEL TABLES ARE CALLED AS "RELASHION" hence the database mode is called relational model 
    as we are having multiple of tables/Realshions


3. each table have their rows and columns.

4. columns represents the attributes of given table/entity.

5. rows / tuples represents data of one data iteam.

    ex:- in table of Students each row represents one student and each column represents attributes related to Students.
    ex:- in table of Proffesor each row represents one Proffesor and each column represents attributes related to Proffesor.
    ex:- in table of subjects each row represents one subject and each column represents attributes related to subject.

6. Degree fo Table => no. of Attributes in table.

    ex:- lets say Students table have attributes/columns like name , surname , age , student_id
         then Degree of table = 4.


7. Cardinality of Table = no. of row/tuples in  a given table.

   i.e Cardinality is basically represents HOW MANY DAPOINTS ARE THERE IN GIVEN DATABASE.
    
    ex:- if Cardinality of Studnets table is 6 , it means database contains information of 6 students.

8. every database is designed in 2 steps.
    1. design of ER model 
    2. design of Relational model (i.e creating tables and relations among them)


------------------------ Relational/Table Schema ----------------------
1. Schema = structure/design of DB.

2. relashionship Schema defines the design and structure of relashions/table(i.e atrtibutes in given table and their types etc..) 
   ex:- inside the College databse where only 2 tables eixists the schema for those relations/tables will look like below 

       Students (std_id , first_name , last_name , age) => relashional schema of Studnets relashion 
       Proffesor (prf_id , first_name , last_name , age) => relashional schema of professor relashion




------------------------- imp. properties of relashions/tables -----------------

1. name of each relashion/table should be unique.
2. values must be atomic(i.e we can't break down the values furthur)
    ex:- if we make table with fullname column then its wrong because full name can be broken into 
         first_name , middle_name , last_name HENCE THIS COLUMN IS WRONG INSTEAD MAKE 3 COLUMNS first_name , middle_name , last_name 

3. each attribute must be unique.(dont make 2 attributes with same name)
4. each tuple/row must be unique. i.e now 2 rows should have same primary key.
5. the sequence of attribute dont have any significance.
    i.e it dosent matter if we swap first row and last row of table as it dosent change anything.
6. tables must follow intigrity constrains.
