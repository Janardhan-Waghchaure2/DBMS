1. Key is a attribute/column or set of attribute which is used to identify a specific row in a given  Table/Relation

2. common key types in Relational Modal are
      1. Primary Key 
      2. Surrogate Key    
      3. Natural Key     
      4. Foreign key 
      5. Composite Key   
      6. Super key
      7. Candidate key    
      8. Alternate key 
      9. compount key 



1. PRIMARY KEY is the key which is a unique value assigned to every row 
   it is used to identify the row uniquely.

   PRIMARY KEY IS THE "FINAL SHORTLISTED KEY FROM Candidate KEYS" which is having least attributes possible 
   to uniqly identify each row. 

   SO NO 2 PRIMARY KEYS COULD BE SAME , NOTE THAT A PRIMARY KEY COULD BE A NUMBER,
   STRING , ETC. IT JUST HAVE TO BE UNIQUE.




2. SURROGATE KEY/artificial key / identity key => it is a key which is system generated UNIQUE
   KEY , which dont have any semantic/meaning to actual user.
   ex:- keys like 100,102,103,104 assigned to a table of employee data are not related to any of
   employee this are just some system generated numbers which uniquely identifies each row of employees.

   NOTE THAT IN SURROGATE KEY WE DONT USE ANY OF USERS DATA , WE JUST GENERATE SOME RANDOM NUMBER AND
   TEXT(WHICH IS UNIQUE / NON-DUPLICATE) AND ASSIGN IT WITH A ROW.

3. Natural key => it is a attribute of users data WHICH IS UNIQUE FOR EACH USER.its exactly opposite of 
   surrogate key where keys are not from user data instead system generated.
   ex:- we can take email id of users as a natural key , as it will be unique for each user.
        we can prn number of student as natural key as it will be unique for each student.


4. Foregion Key=> it is a atribute of users data which is used to map/connect given table with some other table.
  		Or
   A FOREGION KEY IS THE KEYS WHICH DEFINES RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TABLES
                OR
   A FOREGION KEY IS THE PRIMARKY KEY OF SOME OTHER TABLES(IN SAME DATABASE) which then connects that other table/ralation
   with the given table

   Table/Relation whose Primary key is placed in other table is called   parent table .
   Table/Relation in which parent key of other table is placed  is called child table.

5. Composite Key => it is a key which forms by combining multipke keys of the table
   ex:- if a table have 2 fields/attributes/columns as name and age then our composite key will look like
        jay23 , jana20 , rahul19 , etc(i.e combining name and together to form a new key)
  
  why composite keys => if a single key can uniqly identify the give row(ex:- name and age of 2 persons can be
  same for 2 peple in a table) hence we combine them uniquly to form a "unique key"


      	  
6. super key => it is a set of one or more attributes/columns of tables used to uniqly identify the each row/tuple of table.
   ex:- lets say a table have 3 attribute A , B , C then any one the below could be the super key of table.

   super keys  = {A} , {B} , {C} , {A , B} , {B , C} , {A , C} , {A , B , C} , etc... 

   Note :- 1. of A , B , C are themselves can't rerpesent a row uniqly (ex:- name of 2 people can be same) then it can't form super key.
           2. super key can be null also as , super keys is superset of all possible keys hence null is also a possible key.
   SUPER KEY IS BASICALLY SUPERSET OF ALL POSSIBLE KEYS. 


7. Candidate key => it is minimum subset of super keys which don't have any redundant attributes in them.

   ex:- in all the super keys if there was name of person in each of them , then Candidate keys will be all those keys 
   which dont have person name in them AS IT IS A redundant PART OF THE KEY.

   Candidate key is BASICALLY subset of super key which we get after removing redundant attributes.


8. Alternate key => all the keys except Primary key(which we finally selected from Candidate keys) 
                    inside the Candidate key are called alternate keys.
                    as all of them can uniquely identify each row.

9. compount key => keys formed by combining 2 Foregion keys.
