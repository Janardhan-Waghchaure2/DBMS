0. three levels of DBMS are 
    1. view level  
    2. logical/conceptual level
    3. physical level

1. schema :- design of database.

---------------- physical level -----------

2. lowest level of abstraction of DB is physical level.
   here we define how data will be stored in DB.
   low level data structures are used.
   here we talk about storage allocation (N-arry tree, etc) , data compression and encryption , etc.
   also we define the algorithms to efficiently acess , modify and update the datapoints.

---------------- logical level -----------
3. at physical level all the string and numbers are stored in form of bits and bytes. but it's not 
   that much clear to read and understand for humans.

   ex:- lets say we have data of student then in physical memory it will look like 
   name1 , phone1 , address1 , marks1 ,
   name2 , phone2 , address2 , marks2 ,
                    .
                    .
                    .
   name_n , phone_n , address_n , marks_n

   but none of this make sense as everything is just randomly stored in contigues memory location.

   and at logical/conceptual level same thins will be stored in form of table so that 
   it can be unserstood properly.

SR.NO    name    phone    address    marks 
    1    name1   phone1   address1   marks1  
    2    name2   phone2   address2   marks2 
                        .
                        .
                        .
    n    name_n   phone_n   address_n   marks_n    

    and the mapping from physical level to logical/conceptual level is called as "conceptual schema".


    ALSO A GIVEN DATABASE CAN HAVE MULTIPLE TABLES IN IT SO " RALATIONASHIPS OF TABLE IS ALSO STUDIED at
    logical LEVEL."

    SO IN logical LEVEL WE BASICALLY MAP OUR DATA FROM PHYSICAL LEVEL TO logical LEVEL.

---------------- View level -----------

4. at highest level of abstraction is view level.
   as per the need of different users , SAME DATABASE WILL LOOK DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT USERS.
  
   ex:- for different departments of amazon ,views will be as below 

      (department)                   (data attributes visible)
   logistrics department      :- name , address , phone

   customer care department   :- name , phone , product_bought 

   data analytics department  :- region/address , product , selling price , discount 


   SO AMASON IS HAVING ONLY ONE SINGLE DATABASE BUT FOR DIFFERENT DEPARMENTS SAME DATABASE IS LOOKING 
   DIFFERENT(BCAUSE THEY DONT NEED ACCESS TO ENTIRE DATABASE) , HENCE ONLY NEEDED ASPECT OF DB IS SHOWN 
   TO THE DEPARMENTS , THIS IS CALLED AS VIEW OF DB. 


5. COLLECTION OF DATA IN DATABASE AT PERTICULAR TIME IS CALLED AS INSTANCE OF DATABASE.
   
   ex:- for a students database if on first day there were only 3 students info. was there then 
        INSTANCE of database contiains 3 students data.

        on second day if 2 student added more and one removed from database then 
        INSTANCE OF DATABASE ON SENCOND DAY will contians 4 students data.
