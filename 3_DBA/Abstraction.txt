1. hiding of internal working details and only providing necessory interface/tools to user is called as abstraction.
   
    ex:- when we open calling app and call someone we dial number and call but how interanlly working WE DONT KNOW.
        ALL OF THIS DETAILS ARE HIDDEN FROM USER "BECAUSE ITS UNNECESSORY FOR USER".
    
    ex:- while driving car we just need to control sterring , gas , brake ,gears , clutch , etc. we dont know how 
        interanlly everything is working to drive the whole car forward.

2. in same way DBMS also hides how data is created , readed , updated , deleted in level of electronics.
   DBMS SIMPLY PROVIDES US SOME COMMANDS(SQL SYNTAX) TO INTERACT WITH DATABASE WITHOUT GIVING IMPLEMENTATIONAL DETAILS.
