1. singular form of data is datum , which is the fundamental unit of data.
   multiple of datums forms the data.

2. DATA is collection of bits stored in memory.
   multiple of bits forms Bytes/Data.

   note that raw data(LIKE TEXT , IMAGES , AUDIO , VIDIO , ETC FILE) stored inside the memory  dont have any meaning assigned to it.
   when that raw data/bits are processed then it is converted into the useful information.

-------------------- data VS information ----------------------
3. DATA = RAW DATA LIKE TEXT , IMAGES , AUDIO , VIDIO , ETC FILE (bits and bytes in terms of digital computer)
   INFORMATION = processed data (when we organize and make patterns in given data)

   ex:- lets say we have a bunch of numbers(34,56,67,34,73,...) stored in computer THIS IS CALLED DATA (numeric data)
        now this data itself is useless but when we process it then it becomes
        information.

        so when we say that above numbers are marks obtained by students.

        ex:- who is topper of all student => information which is created from data.
             what's the average marks of students => information which is created from data.
             who are top 10 rankers in class , etc...
   
        so in this way simple plane number don't have any meaning assisnged to it
        but when we process it THEN IT FORMS THE INFORMATION WHICH IS MEANINGFUL.
  
   ex:- 19042001 is just a random number but when we assingn meaning to it then it becomes information
        information = above number is birth data = 19/04/2001
