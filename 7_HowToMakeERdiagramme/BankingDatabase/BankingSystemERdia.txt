requirements of Banking System DB.(get this with requirement engineering)
    1. There will be multiple branches of the bank.
    2. customer entities.
    3. customers have accounts and they can take loans also.
    4. each customer will be associated with some banker(Employee of bank).
    5. bank is having some Employees.
    6. accounts are of 2 type 
        1. savings 
        2. current
    7. loan is originated by some specific branch.
    8. a loan can exists on one or more customer. 
       (i.e a loan is taken collboratively over 2 or 3 or more customers.)


step1 :- identify entities
    1. branch
    2. customer
    3. Employee
    4. savings account
    5. current account
    6. loan 
    7. loan payment(weak entity)


step2 :- identify attributes    
    1. branch           => name(primary_key) , assets  , liabilities
    2. customer         => cust_id(primary_key) , name , address(composite attributes) , contact_no(multivalued attribute) , DOB , age(derived attributes)  
    3. Employee         => emp_id(primary_key) , name ,contact_no , depedant_name(multivalued) , starting_date , year_of_serive(derived attribute) 
    4. savings account  => acc_number(primary_key) , balance , interest_rate , daily_withdrawal_limit.
    5. current account  => acc_number(primary_key) , balance , interest_rate , pretransactionCharges , overdraftAmount.
    6. loan             => loan_number(primary_key) , amount 
    7. loan payment     => payment_number , date , amount


step3 :- relationship and constraints
    1. customer borrow loan.
        1. mapping cardinality constrins:
            M : N => one person can hold N loans and one loan can be shared over M people
        
        2. participation constrains:
            loan will be in total participation as loan can't exists without customer 
            customer will be in partial participation as there could be a customer without loan.

    
    2. loan originated-by branch.
        1. mapping cardinality constrins:
            N : 1 => one loan can be originated by only one branch but one branch can originate multiple loans.
        
        2. participation constrains:
            loan origination can't exists without branch hence loan will be in total participation.
            but branch can exists without existance of loan hence branch will be in partial participation.  

    
    3. loan loan-payment payment.
        1. mapping cardinality constrins:
            1 : N => one loan can have multiple payments but a given payment can only occur for 1 loan.
        
        2. participation constrains:
            loan can exist without paymet(i.e you have taken the loan but you are not paying) hence laon is partial participation.
            but loan-payment can't exists without loan (why would you pay if you haven't taken money from bank) hence loan-payment 
            is in complete participation

    
    4. customer deposit account.
        1. mapping cardinality constrins:
            M : N => one customer can have multiple accounts and multiple accounts can be shared over multiple people(this is called joint account).
        
        2. participation constrains:
            both will be in partial paritcipation as none of them can exists without other.

    
    5. customer banker Employee.(i.e each customer will have an bank person assigned to do bank related things)
        1. mapping cardinality constrins:
            N : 1 => one customer can have only one bank employee assigned.
            and one bank employee can have multiple customers assigned to him/her. 

        2. participation constrains:
            both will be in partial paritcipation as none of them can exists without other.        
    
    6. employee manged-by employee.(unary relationship)
        1. mapping cardinality constrins:
            N : 1 => one employee is managed by only one employee(called manager) and one manager can have multiple 
                     employee which he have to manage 

        2. participation constrains:
            both will be in partial paritcipation as none of them can exists without other.
