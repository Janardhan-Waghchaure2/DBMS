1. if we delete parent tables row then child table row will be pointing to the primary key 
   of parent table which don't exists so in that case there are 2 solutions for that.
        1. delete ALL the child rows which were pointing to the deleted primary table rows => ON DELETE CASCADE 
        2. assign null on the child rows which were pointing to the delted primary table rows => ON DELETE SET NULL


2. consider  a Customer table with id as the primary key.

    CREATE TABLE Customer(
        id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                .
                .
                .
                .
                .
   );

   and also consider below Order table which refrances to Customer table through FOREIGN key.

   CREATE TABLE Order(
        order_id INT PRIMARY KEY ,
                .
                .
                .
                .
                .
        FOREIGN KEY(cust_id) refrances Customer(id) ON DELETE CASECASE 
   );

   now whenever we delete some customer from database then the orders which were pointing 
   to those customers will also get deleted.

3. consider  a Customer table with id as the primary key.

    CREATE TABLE Customer(
        id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                .
                .
                .
                .
                .
   );

   and also consider below Order table which refrances to Customer table through FOREIGN key.

   CREATE TABLE Order(
        order_id INT PRIMARY KEY ,
                .
                .
                .
                .
                .
        FOREIGN KEY(cust_id) refrances Customer(id) ON DELETE SET NULL 
   );

   now whenever we delete some customer from database then FOREGION KEYS of the orders which were pointing 
   to those customers will be set to null.
