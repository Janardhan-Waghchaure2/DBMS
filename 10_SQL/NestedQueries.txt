WE CAN NESTE MULTIPLE SELECT STATEMETS IN EACH OTHER TO SEARCH
PERTICULAR DATA.
basically inner select statement searches the some chunk of information
and then outer select statement searches some other chunk of information
based on inner select statements output.


syntax:
    SELECT attr1 , attr2 FROM table1
    WHERE table2.attr3 IN (
	SELECT attr4 FROM table3 
	WHERE attr5 > value5 //=> THERE COULD BE ANY CONDITION AFTER WHERE CLAUSE.
    );

** in case of nested queries , inner queries are resoved first
   then outer queries are resolved.
