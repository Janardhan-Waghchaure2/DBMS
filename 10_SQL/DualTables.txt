1. There may be a situation where we want to query something that is not from a table.  
   For example, getting the current date or querying a simple arithmetic expression like 2+2

2. it is a system generated table created by database.

3. we can use select clause to do some basic arithmatics like 
    1. SELECT 2+2;

4. from here its clear that we dont need FROM keyword to use SELECT keyword.
