1.  set is collection of well defined unique objects in mathmatics.

2. set operations are 
    1. UNION 
    2. INTERSECTION
    3. MINUS

3. UNION 
   note that joins are concatnating 2 tables horizontally.
   i.e resultant table will join collumns of both tables to form 
   more columns.

   whereas set operations joins 3 tables row wise.
   i.e number of rows increases in resultant table.


    table 1 
   | div   |  students  |  
   |  a    |  1         |   
   |  c    |  5         |  
   |  b    |  9         |  


    table 2

   |  div   |  students  |  
   |  x     |  5         |   
   |  a     |  1         |  
   |  b     |  3         |  

   SET UNION of table 1 and table 2 is 

   |  div   |  students  |  
   |  a     |  1         |   
   |  c     |  5         |  
   |  b     |  9         |
   |  b     |  3         |
   |  x     |  5         | 

   note that as a-1 was common in both hence it is taken ones in final table.
   also note that both column are same i.e div and students.
   so we cant union columns which arent same.

   UNION SYNTAX:- 

        SELECT * FROM table1
        UNION 
        SELECT * FROM table2;

    ** FROM ABOVE WE CAN SEE THAT "SET OPERATIONS COMBINES 2 SELECT STATEMENTS"


4. INTERSECT (intersect keyword dont exists in SQL so we have to use inner join to emulate this INTERSECT keyword.)
   
    intersect will stack two tables vertically with rows which exists in both tables i.e intersection of 2 tables.


   SYNTAX:-
        SELECT DISTINCT id FROM T1 
        INNER JOIN T2 
        USING (id);

5. MINUS (minus keyword dont exists in SQL so we have to emulate it.)

   A - B means only considering rows of A which are not in intersection of A and B.
