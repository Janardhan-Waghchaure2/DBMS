0. we can search for a perticular data(string data) which follows a pattern 
   this is called pattern searching/wild card.

1. SELECT *
   FROM table_name
   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '% some_word';


   above commands will display all the rows
   where 'attribute_name' attribute will contain 
   'some_word' word at the last of word.

   here % sign represents a sequence of characters.
   
   if the word to be searched lies in the middle somewhere
   then just add one more % at the end of word like below
   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '%some_word%';


2. SELECT * 
   FROM table_name
   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '__someword%';
  
   in above commands will display all the rows 
   where 'attribute_name' will contain 
   'someword' word 'EXACTLY AFTER 2 CHARACTERS'
   as one underscore represents one charcter length




   % => any number of characters
   _ => one character 


3. below are some possible patterns with % and -

   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '_word%'; ==> seraching all text where "word" lies after one character from front 
   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '__word%'; ==> seraching all text where "word" lies after 2 character from front 
   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '___word%'; ==> seraching all text where "word" lies after 3 character from front 

   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '%word_'; ==> seraching all text where "word" lies after one character from back 
   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '%word__'; ==> seraching all text where "word" lies after 2 character from back 
   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '%word___'; ==> seraching all text where "word" lies after 3 character from back 

   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '%word%'; ==> seraching all text where "word" lies between the text.

   WHERE attribute_name LIKE '_word_'; ==> seraching all text where "word" lies between in length 6 text.
