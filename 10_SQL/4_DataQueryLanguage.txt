----------------------- DISTINCT --------------------
1. we can select the distict values from all the values column is having
   ex:- a gender column will have all male or female values hence

   SELECT DISTINCT gender 
   FROM employee;
   
   will return male and female as entire column is just taking 
   2 distinct values. 


2. SELECT DISTINCT department
   FROM COMPANY;

   => return all the distinct departments(HR , Research , Design , Sales)
      in a COMPANY.








----------------------- Group By ----------------------
** used to group together similar values of perticular attributes.

1. department attribute can have 3 values:- HR , Design , Sales.

   the GROUP BY will return 
   the number of people which belongs to those departments.


   SELECT department , COUNT(department)
   FROM worker_table 
   GROUP BY department; 

   output=>

       (department)  COUNT(department)
         HR          =  100
         Design      =  45  
         Sales       =  37


2. grouping together max salary in each department


   SELECT department , MAX(salary)
   FROM worker_table 
   GROUP BY department; 

   output=>

       (department)  MAX(salary)
         HR          =  100000 Rs 
         Design      =  45000  Rs  
         Sales       =  37000  Rs 

   similarly we can use MIN() , AVG() , SUM() functions to find MIN, AVG and Total salary per department.


3. note that if we dont use aggregation functions along with GROUP BY then output will be same as 
   of the DISTINCT keyword.











-------------------------- HAVING ------------------------
** having is similar to where , like where is used with select cluase.
in same way having is used with group by.

** HAVING dont work without group-by.

i.e whenever we select some rows from GROUP BY COMMAND 
    then to furthur select those rows by some condition.


    we know that below thing will give ALL THE  departments WTIH THEIR employee COUNT.
    NOW IF WE WANT TO FURHTER SELECT ONLY THOSE department-count(department) rows which are "HAVING" 
    count(department) > 40



   SELECT department , COUNT(department)
   FROM worker_table 
   GROUP BY department; 

   output=>

       (department)  COUNT(department)
         HR          =  100
         Design      =  45  
         Sales       =  37


   SELECT department , COUNT(department)
   FROM worker_table 
   GROUP BY department
   HAVING COUNT(department) > 40; 

   output=>

       (department)  COUNT(department)
         HR          =  100
         Design      =  45  

   
   ** as sales department had only 37 employee init hence it didnt got selected 
      in our HAVING CONDITION.

1. WHERE VS HAVING.
   1. WHERE is used for filtering the rows depending on some condition.
   2. HAVING is used fof filtering "groups" which are formed by "GROUP BY" keyword.
      ex:- in above example we have filtered department column and grouped them 
           together on department attribute. i.e all HR will be in one gruop , all Design are in one gruop ,etc..
      
      so HAVING IS NOT FOR FILTERING INDIVISUAL ROWS , IT IS FOR FILTERING GROUPS.
