1. data models is a way through which we can descirbe the design of DB at logical level.

   ** DATA MODELS ARE ALL ABOUT LOGICAL LEVEL OF DATABASE **

2. it provides conceptual understanding of data , data relations , data semantics , consistancy constrains.

3. types of Data Models 
    1. ER model.
    2. Relational model.
    3. Object Oriented model.
    4. Object-Relational model.

------------- Database Lagnuages ------------------

1. to interact with Database we need a Lagnuage.

2. types of database Lagnuages.
   1. DDL :- Data defination Lagnuage => to desing the schema(logical schema) of DB.
   2. DML :- Data manipulation Language => to create , read , update , delete data in database.
   3. DQL :- Data Query Language => to Query info from database(part of DML).
   4. DCL :- Data control Lagnuage => Data Administrator uses DCL to handle the access of info/data across all users of database.


   NOTE :- there are no 2 seperate languages for DDL , DML , DQL and DML both comes packed together in SQL(Structured Query Lagnuage)

3. whenever we write applications then they are noramlly in javascript, c/c++ ,python , java ,etc.. but databases understand 
   SQL hence for each languages there is an API(application programme interface) which allows communication between database and 
   given programming language.


   ex:- java have JDBC(Java Database Connctivity) to fetch from DB with java syntax.
        c/c++ have ODBC to  to fetch from DB with c/c++ syntax.

4. database Administrator :- A database administrator is a technical guardian of data. 
   With the assistance of database administration, the administrator manages the data resources for different 
   applications and purposes. It includes: Database Performance and Monitoring, and so much more
