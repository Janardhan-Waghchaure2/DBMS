0. server = node =  BIG sized computer which serves user requests

1. clustering = replication = placing multiple servers instances which all are having same data on them
                              (i.e they are exact replica of each other)

2. instead of having a one single server , when we make multiple servers/multiple instances of server 
   WHERE EACH SERVER INSTANCE IS HAVING EXACT SAME DATA(ex:- if server A have 1000 users data init then
   server B will also have EXACT SAME USERS DATA INIT) 
   these set of servers are called as clustering.


3. why to introduce redundancy(unnecessorly copying same data on different servers) ?
    1. as we have multiple instances of servers hence even if some server instance goes down ,
       or turned off due to technical problems , it is under maintainance , etc..
       then other servers will take over and handle the situation.

    2. this increses availability and reduces down time.

    3. this architecture also helps to do load balencing.
