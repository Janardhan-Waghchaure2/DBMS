1. indexing types
        1. primary indexing 
                1. Sparse indexing (if primary key is used for search key)
                2. Dense  indexing (if non-primary key is used for search key)
        
        2. secondary indexing 


2. secondary indexing is used where DB file is not sorted on any attribute.
            OR 
    if file is already sorted on one attribute then FOR SURE IT WILL GET UNSORTED ON OTHER 
    ATTRIBUTES. ex:- if we sort on age then rollnumber , height ,weight  , marks will get 
    un-sorted automatically.
    then if we wants to make index files based on some other attributes then also secondary 
    indexing can be used.


3. as we dont have sorted entries in table hence we need to use dense  indexing 
   i.e we need to store each and every entry of DB in index table.
