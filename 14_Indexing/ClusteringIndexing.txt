1. Clusturing is a type of Primary Indexing.
   primary indexing basically means that rocords are arrenged in sorted order. 
   such that search key gets orderd in a sorted order.

2. in Clusturing indexing , there we use non-primary key attributes as search key.
   so as search key may have duplicate values hence Clusturing becomes DENSE INDEXING.
   as we are using each unque search key in index file.


3. consider a table as below.


                        DB table 
    
    Primary_Key      field1      field2(non-primary key)    field3     field4     
         a            -                1                                         
         b            -                1 
         c            -                1
         e            -                2
         f            -                2
         g            -                3
         h            -                4
         i            -                4  
    

    note that field2 can have duplicate values init.
    lets say that each block have 2 size . i.e each block will have 2 recoreds init.


                        index table for above table 
   Non-Primary key 
   attribute (Search key)                    Refrances/addresses 
        (field2)

        1.                                      B1 address
        2.                                      B2 address
        3.                                      B3 address
        4.                                      B4 address

    Refrances column of index table stores the address of block which is having value of field2 
    firstly present init.

4. in above index file  we can see that serach key of index table is having 
   each unique attribute of DB table.

   also note that 1 is lieing not just in B1 but also in B2 block , so if we wants to 
   reatrive all the tuples for field2=1 then start searching in B1 address and 
   keep going down until field2=1.


5. note that in table all the rows which are having field2 = 1 are getting clustered 
   (means similar data is getting clustered) hence it is called as Clusturing.
