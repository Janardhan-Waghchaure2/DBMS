1. types of indexing
    1. Primary Index

        

2. Primary Index.
    
    1. A File(DB file) can have multiple index files/index data structure , BASED ON CHOICE ON SEARCH KEY.
       ex:- for a student table there are multiple SEARCH key possible like age , roll no. , prn , 
            height , weight , Adhar card no., phone number , etc..
        
    2. If DB files are already arrenged in such a way that all the search key are in sorted 
       order then we call these DB files as Primary index. 

    3. in a DB file , its not necessory that search key should be "Primary KEY" of the table.
       it can be or it cannot be the primary key of the table.
       
       also dont confuse word primary in "Primary Index" with primary key, it dosent mean that search key in 
       Primary Index should be primary key of table.
