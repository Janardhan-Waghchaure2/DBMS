1. if data is on very very large scale (like data of country) then making single level index file 
   is not sufficient so to handle this we make index files on multiple level 
   (primary level index , secondary level index ,etc..)


2. so we search the given key in first table then we get corrsoponding address then on that address 
   we again search the same key and so on depending on levels of indexing.
