1. sharding is a technique to apply horizontal partitioning.

2. lets say we have a table with 1000 tuples init and we have 2 servers s1 and s2.

        s1 stores 1-500  records/tuples init.
        s2 stores 500-1000  records/tuples init.

        ** shard means server here.

    now whenever user's requests id is between 1-500 then request will be directed to s1 otherwise s2.
    and to do this directing we need a routing system which will direct users requests to right 
    server/shards.


3. advantages of sharding   
    1. it scales the system.
    2. availability of system increases.

4. dis-advantages of sharding.
    1. complexity , making partition mapping , Routing layer needs to be implemented in system.
    2. non-uniformity(putting uneven number of rows in each servers) creates need of resharding
      (to make the number of rows in each table equal)
