WHY WE NEED DBMS , WHY DO NORMAL/TRADITIONAL FILE SYSTEM(which are used to manage the files/directories inside computer) 

Difference between File System and DBMS: 
Basis	                            File System	                            DBMS

Structure           The file system is software that manages 
                    and organizes the files in a storage medium             DBMS is software for managing the database.
                    within a computer.	

Data Redundancy	    Redundant data can be present in a file system.	        In DBMS there is no redundant data.

Backup and Recovery	It doesnâ€™t provide backup and recovery                  It provides backup and recovery of data even if it is lost.
                    of data if it is lost.	

Query processing	There is no efficient query processing                  Efficient query processing is there in DBMS.
                    in the file system.	

Consistency	        There is less data consistency in the file system.	    There is more data consistency because of 
                                                                            the process of normalization.


Complexity	        It is less complex as compared to DBMS.	                It has more complexity in handling as compared to the file system.

Security Constraints File systems provide less security 
                    in comparison to DBMS.	                                DBMS has more security mechanisms as compared to file systems.


Cost	            It is less expensive than DBMS.	                        It has a comparatively higher cost than a file system.

Data Independence	There is no data independence.	                        In DBMS data independence exists.

User Access	        Only one user can access data at a time.	            Multiple users can access data at a time.

Meaning	            The user has to write procedures for managing databases	The user not required to write procedures.

Sharing 	        Data is distributed in many files. So,                  Due to centralized nature sharing is easy 
                    not easy to share data	

Data Abstraction	It give details of storage and representation of data	It hides the internal details of Database

Integrity           Integrity Constraints are difficult to implement	    Integrity constraints are easy to implement 
Constraints	

Atomicity           difficult to implement Atomicity                        Easy to implement Atomicity

concurrent          difficult to implement concurrent Accessing             Easy to implement concurrent Accessing.   
Accessing 

Security            less security in file systems.                          more security in DBMS.

fetching data	    Cobol, C++ ,python                                 	    Oracle, SQL Server
                    (as programming languages can manipulate the files)
