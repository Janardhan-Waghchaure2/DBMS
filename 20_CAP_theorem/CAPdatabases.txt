1. CA Databases :- 
    1. these databases allows Consistancy and Avaialbility at same time.
    2. but in reality some partitioning/communication fault could happen hece these are not practical databases.
       this we can find some DB's which are CA types.


2. CP Databases :- 
    1. these databases allows Consistancy and Partition Tolerance at same time.
       i.e if communication between 2 nodes is breaked then system will loose Avaialbility if we choose Consistancy.
    
    2. in CP databases if communication goes between 2 nodes then the nodes which are getting 
       read requests are turned off. due to which Avaialbility gets lost.
      
       and whenever inconsistancy is removed after communication is back then those nodes are again brough online.

    ex:- banking systems follows CP architecture beacuse WE CANT AFFORED TO HAVE INCONSISTANCY ACORSS NODES.
         we cant allow to show 100 rs balance on one server and same account is showing 200 rs balance on other server.
      
3. AP Databases :
    1. these databases allows Avaialbility and partion Tolerance at same time.
       i.e if communication betweeen 2 nodes is breaked then system will loose Consistancy if we choose Avaialbility.
    
    2. in partitioning all the nodes will be Avaialble for reading operations. and whenever communication is reestablished 
       then all the data will be replicated.

    3. in social media applications its not a big problem if some likes are not shown due to communication lost 
       ones communication is back then all the right data will be diplated to user.
